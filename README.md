# Word Cloud
This project was done in relation to Google Crash Course in Python.
A word cloud is an image made of words that together resemble a cloudy shape. The size of a word shows how important it is e.g. how often it appears in a text â€” its frequency.

# Input file
For the input file, you need to provide a file that contains text only. For the text itself, you can copy and paste the contents of a website you like.
